# Radix file serving

This is a simple file serving setup for the Radix File Storage concept in Svelte: https://github.com/thereturnofyo/radix-file-storage.

Clone the repo and deploy (to Vercel for example) to start serving files.

The file route looks like /file/{internal key_value store address}/{file hash}
